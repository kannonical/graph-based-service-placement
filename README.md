# graph-based-service-placement

A very simple form of the service placement heuristic is shared here. First all paths are identified between the a given node (video service instance in the paper) to the end node (control node in the paper). Once all paths are identified between two nodes, both node capacity (resource capacity of the node) and the link capacity are checked before placing linear service graph on infrastrcuture graph.
